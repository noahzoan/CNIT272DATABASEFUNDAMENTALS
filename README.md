This repository documents the fundamental database concepts learned and practiced through the semester. 
Using Oracle SQL Developer (Oracle 11g), students performed hands-on tasks using SQL concepts learned in class. This can be seen in the labs folder.
The project folder documents the cumulative semester group project that was completed in conjunction with another class.
We were asked to create a small database off of a case study which was further expanded upon in the other class. 
The first phase of the project was to create the relational schema of our database through Oracle SQL Data Modeler.
The second phase was to use Data Definition Language (DDL) to define the structure of the database through the creation of tables, indexes, and defining variables.
